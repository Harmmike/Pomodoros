# Pomodoros

A simple app to keep track of time and help me stay consistent on projects/study. Initially this will be a Console app using the timer class and the beep function. Later, I would like to change this into a web app with a database to keep record of what's been done.

1. Decide on the task to be done.
2. Set the pomodoro timer (typically for 25 minutes).
3. Work on the task.
4. End work when the timer rings and take a short break (typically 5â€“10 minutes).
5. If you have fewer than three pomodoros, go back to Step 2 and repeat until you go through all three pomodoros.
6. After three pomodoros are done, take the fourth pomodoro and then take a long break (traditionally 20 to 30 minutes). Once the long break is finished, return to step 2.


After task completion in a pomodoro, any remaining time should be devoted to activities, for example:

Review your work just completed.
Review the activities from a learning point of view (ex: What learning objective did you accomplish? What learning outcome did you accomplish? Did you fulfill your learning target, objective, or outcome for the task?)
Review the list of upcoming tasks for the next planned pomodoro time blocks, and start reflecting on or updating them.
